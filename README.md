# Custom-Java-Checkstyle-Formatter
This formats Java programs based on my school's checkstyle guide.  

So far, the extension
    Indents braces to the next line
    Fixes the } else { by indenting the else and "{" to the next line
    Replaces ++i with i++ if toggling the extension to do so
    Fixes all indentation given an indentation preference
    Fixes indentation or checkstyle for selections of code
    Temporarily deletes empty lines
    Adds braces to single statements
    Adds all necessary javadoc comments before a method or class
